# PR Grill Me Skill (pi-adapted)

Interviews the author about what their PR is supposed to do, then holds the diff up to those answers to find discrepancies — things the code doesn't do that it should, things it does that it shouldn't, and edge cases that weren't considered.

Uses only the four core tools (**Read, Write, Edit, Bash**) plus `git`. No harness-specific tools required — the "interview" is just plain questions asked in chat, one at a time.

## Inputs

- **PR number** (required). If not provided, ask for it (Step 1).
- Runs inside the target repo (current directory).

## Workflow

### 1. Get the PR number and repo

If the user didn't give a PR number, ask:
> "What's the PR number? (I'll infer the repo from your git remote.)"

Infer the repo from the remote:
```bash
git remote get-url origin
# git@github.com:myorg/myrepo.git   → owner=myorg repo=myrepo
# https://github.com/myorg/myrepo.git → owner=myorg repo=myrepo
```
If the remote is **not GitHub** (GitLab, Bitbucket, self-hosted), the `pull/<N>/head` ref used below is GitHub-specific. For other hosts, ask the user for the source branch name and diff that branch against the base instead (`git fetch origin <branch>` then `git diff HEAD..FETCH_HEAD`).

### 2. Fetch the PR diff

Fetch the PR branch and generate a full diff against the current base:
```bash
git fetch origin pull/<PR_NUMBER>/head:pr-<PR_NUMBER>
git log pr-<PR_NUMBER> --not HEAD --pretty="%s%n%b"   # commit messages = stated intent
git diff HEAD..pr-<PR_NUMBER>                          # the actual change
```

Read the diff and the commit messages carefully. **Do NOT show the diff to the user yet, and do not summarize it for them** — read and internalize it silently. You'll use it to evaluate their answers, and the contrast only works if they answer from memory rather than from your summary.

### 3. Grill the author

Ask these questions **one at a time**, waiting for the user's answer before asking the next. Do not paste all seven at once — that defeats the purpose.

1. **Elevator pitch:** "In one or two sentences, what does this PR do?"
2. **Trigger:** "What problem or situation does this fix or enable? Walk me through the scenario that motivated it."
3. **What changes:** "What parts of the codebase did you need to touch, and why each one?"
4. **What stays the same:** "What existing behavior must not change as a result of this PR? How did you verify that?"
5. **Edge cases:** "What edge cases or failure modes did you consider? Which does the PR handle, and which did you intentionally leave out?"
6. **Testing:** "How would someone verify this works? Are there tests, and if not, how did you validate it?"
7. **Anything sketchy:** "Is there anything in the diff you're unsure about, cut corners on, or want a second opinion on?"

When an answer is vague or contradicts what you already see in the diff, probe with one or two follow-up questions — conversational, not an interrogation.

### 4. Analyze the diff against the answers

Cross-reference everything the user said against the actual diff. Look for gaps in each category:

- **Scope gaps** — files changed the user didn't mention, or files they mentioned that weren't changed.
- **Behavior gaps** — functionality they described that the diff doesn't implement, or behavior the diff changes that they didn't mention.
- **Edge-case gaps** — cases they said are handled but no code/test covers, or code paths handling cases they never mentioned.
- **Test gaps** — behavior claimed as verified but no test exists or was changed.
- **Unintended changes** — whitespace-only churn on logic files, commented-out code, debug statements, scope creep into unrelated areas.
- **Consistency gaps** — stated intent contradicts what the diff does (e.g. "I only changed the API layer" but a model file was modified).

### 5. Deliver the report

Open with a one-sentence summary of what the PR **actually** does based on the diff (not the user's description — the contrast is intentional). Then:

---

## PR Grill Report: #<NUMBER>

**What you said it does:** <user's elevator pitch>
**What the diff actually does:** <your read of the diff>

### Gaps & Discrepancies

For each finding:

**[Category]** — <one-sentence description>
> _You said:_ "<quote from their answer>"
> _The diff:_ <what the code actually shows>
> _Risk:_ Low / Medium / High
> _Suggestion:_ <concrete action — add a test, revert a file, document a decision, handle a case>

### Unaddressed Edge Cases

Edge cases you spotted in the diff that the user never mentioned and that aren't covered by tests or guards.

### What Looks Good

One or two things where the diff clearly matches the stated intent — keep the author grounded.

### Verdict

**Ready for review** — Intent and implementation align. Minor gaps noted above.

— or —

**Needs a pass** — <N> meaningful discrepancies found. Address the High-risk items before requesting review.

— or —

**Significant gaps** — The diff diverges from stated intent in ways that suggest the PR isn't finished or has unintended side effects. Revisit before review.

### 6. Clean up

```bash
git branch -D pr-<PR_NUMBER>
```

## Tone Guidelines

- Be direct but not harsh. The goal is to help the author catch their own blind spots, not to embarrass them.
- Quote their own words back when calling out a gap — it's harder to dismiss.
- Prioritize by risk. Don't bury a High-risk gap under five Low-risk nits.
- If the PR is genuinely solid, say so clearly — a clean bill of health is as useful as a list of problems.
